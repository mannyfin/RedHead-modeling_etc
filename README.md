# RedHead-modeling_etc
Older MATLAB programs I made to model data using the Redhead method. 

I **may** convert everything over to Python 3+ in the future.

The proper modeling data should include a flux temperature correction using the Hertz Knudsen equation 
(If I recall correctly). I have an example file included to test things out

HidenTPDreadNplot was a program I made in MATLAB for quick plotting files from the Hiden RGA mass spectrometer. 

This is not actively maintained.
